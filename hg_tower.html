        <h2>Rule an Ancient City</h2>
       
        <p>Towers and Temples is the winner of the 2017 Palmer 
        Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game. 
        Players adopt role cards of characters from ancient 
        Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage 
        the administration of a city. Each role provides 
        a different ability and strategy. However, 
        one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players 
        must be constantly aware of betrayal 
        and double-cross. This card game provides a ton 
        of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players 
        and expansion packs available for larger parties.</p>
        
        <p>This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must 
        carefully choose his or her roles and 
        the strategies can quickly change with the turn 
        of a card. However the level of randomness is 
        just right and cunning and resourcefulness can 
        overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not 
        recommend this game unless there are at least 4 
        players; less than that reduces the intrigue 
        and some of the game appeal.</p>

        <h2>Highly Recommended</h2>
        
        <p>Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is 
        just about perfect and each player must 
        carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the 
        strategic possibilities are nearly endless, 
        the game is simple to learn. The replay value is 
        high and gets even better when you replace 
        some of the cards with new cards available in the 
        expansion packs.</p>

        <h2>Great Strategic Board Game</h2>
        
        <p>We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2 
        to 6 players and we can strongly 
        recommend the game. The different phases of the 
        game are interesting and intriguing, from
        bluffing and stealing to site construction and planning. 
        With the variety of cards and 
        scenarios, no two games are ever quite the same. It's 
        a great introduction to the world of 
        strategic board games and role playing.</p>

        <h2>An Incredible Game</h2>
        
        <p>The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent 
        and one of the best around. As 
        for play, this game offers lots of strategy, and there 
        are tough decisions to make every 
        turn. It's not only important to select the character 
        that increases your chances for scoring, 
        but also to anticipate the characters the opponents 
        are likely to select, and then hedge against 
        their availability. This causes a lot of unpredictability 
        and deep strategic thinking. However, 
        it can still be played at a more basic level for 
        younger users.</p>
        
        <p>We had a lot of fun with this game and rate it as 
        Best in its Class. Highly recommended.</p>
